Over the years, i met several people that left quite an impact on me and, in many cases, helped me along the way.

I tried to summarize one learning from each.

I split it into stages of my life. Growing up in Vienna; moving to London and Berlin, running my own companies, moving to SF to work on multiple companies there… etc.  

A lot of the people i mention here overlapped in different phases of my life. 
E.g. the people i hired for our startup later also joined companies i worked at in San Francisco – i tried to put them into the buckets where i met them the first time or where we worked together the most.

Besides this attempt at structure, this list is in no particular order and misses about 1000000 people, most likely including you.


## Vienna

I grew up in Vienna, my family comes from the rural south of Austria (running [this cottage](https://www.millstaettersee.com/en/millstatt/info/schwaigerhuette-1625-m.html) in the mountains for the longest time)

I have a very confusing CV – and given that i grew up in Vienna, most of that confusing stuff happened here. 

Next to university, i ran online communities, worked as a cheap freelancer, which i called "computer science prostitution" – decided to focus on facebook apps by starting an agency, ran a music magazine, organized club parties, tried helping overthrow the leadership in a political party as well as the national tv organization, was very active in helping to build the local startup scene, and launched my own startup.

But step by step…

### Local startup scene

Vienna has a fantastic startup scene nowadays. When I started, there were less than 3 or 5 other startups (in the modern sense) around. 

We had a lot of groundwork to do. We organized Barcamps and tried to get the media's attention on the growing startup. Which led to me being in [funny](https://scontent.ftxl2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/60180_472884485855_3195182_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ba80b0&_nc_ohc=vU2yk0oAubYAX9skiHO&_nc_ht=scontent.ftxl2-1.fna&oh=00_AT8ljblYXzLlVdK2kfSaN9jbj-cKOfKcNb30gI62RFI9-g&oe=623BC450) media [coverage](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153905310480856&set=t.728700855&type=3) scene.

### Our Magazine 

Somewhere during my university time, my cousin and i decided to start a [music magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20100304035229/http://www.resident.at/about/resident-sagt-danke) and organized [club parties](https://fsc.szene1.at/fijn/23075/fijn_23075.jpg) – usually [200-500 people](https://www.szene1.at/event/2_jahre_resident_the_zoo_wien_meidling_13-10-2007-eid76973), sometimes up to 2000 people.

This was a [weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrKh1dum77U) phase of my life where [everyone i knew](https://scontent.ftxl2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/657_50891115855_1621_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=cdbe9c&_nc_ohc=QHGqqojyGjsAX9NnrDs&_nc_ht=scontent.ftxl2-1.fna&oh=00_AT8DsRG5rVgWAPktH2glrtZuknXwtVEIbCBft2s-w4o6ag&oe=623CDCA5) was either nerd or DJ or both.

### School

- [Klaus Coufal](https://href.li/?https://coufal.at/) (IT Teacher) - _the goal of every job is to make sure you are not needed (automate or hire yourself out of your job)_

### Overclockers.at - my first community project

Before working as a freelancer, i helped getting an [online community](https://overclockers.at/) off the ground. 
Overclockers.at was, at it's peak, one of the most active forums worldwide (by member activity). 

Nowadays, it's hard to explain how influential, active and tight this community was during this phase. 

To give you an idea: At meetups, the admins had nametags reading: "One of the gods" and we had 100-200 people screaming chants.

- [Reinhard Teischl](https://twitter.com/rteischl/) (Founder) - _dont build communities; build cults_
- [Stephan Blecher](https://blecher.at) (absurdly efficient and pragmatic lead dev) – _the output of the best engineers i not code, but effective product_


### die.socialisten - my first company

I worked as a mid-priced, sometimes cheap, "freelancer by the hour" for a long time. I called it computer-science prostituion as i would basically build anything for anyone who was ok to pay my (very low) hourly rate.

After learning about [willingness to pay](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/willingness-to-pay#:~:text=What%20Is%20Willingness%20to%20Pay,for%20a%20product%20or%20service.&text=While%20potential%20customers%20are%20likely,t%20pay%20a%20higher%20price.) i realized that always somewhere someone made the money i didn't ask for. Which, to someone charging by the hour and taking pride in how fast i worked, was a world-shattering insight. 

So i switched my strategy and focused on niches where i could be the #1 provider and charge for whole projects, not just implementation. I also started to speak of myself in plural, to pretend that i had a team.

The niche i picked was "social network software applications". (This was before Social Media was a common term)

My little "fake agency" quickly became a real agency when my co-founder joined. We built facebook apps, myspace apps, linkedin apps, twitter apps, anything where we could create exciting user engagement. Thanks to my co-founder, this agency exists to this day and runs one of the [leading social media management tools](https://swat.io/).

- [Michi Kamleitner](https://twitter.com/_subnet) (Co-Founder) - _hard work and persistence is the only magic trick_
- [Jo Nagl](https://twitter.com/jollife) (CTO) – _never, never ever, lose your best people_

### [Garmz.com](https://href.li/?https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/15/garmz-com-launches-as-a-fashion-game-changer/) - my first startup

At some point, i realized that all the ideas we pitched to clients could be standalone concepts. 

I got frustrated coming up with ideas and then seeing the same ideas (as startup) on Techcrunch raising money.

Around the same time, by accident, i ran into my co-founders, and we decided to form a team to work on a [big idea of ours](https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/31/garmz-pivots-to-become-lookk-aims-to-disrupt-fashion-industry-cycle). Reinventing the fashion industry. (Why start small?). I blogged about the [experience in german](https://thegap.at/autor/andreasklinger/)
 
- [Tamas Locher](https://twitter.com/tamaslocher) (Ex Co-Founder) - _start with the best possible solution and – only then – work backward to reality_
- Simone Ospelt (Fashion Production Manager, now running digital agencies) - _you can apply your skills to any problems, even if unrelated to your experience_
- Rafael Jimenez (Fashion Marketing Guru) - _fashion is not clothing; fashion is art&culture applied to our life. And life is shallow without art and culture_
- [Rado](https://twitter.com/rstankov) (now CTO of Product Hunt) - _being positive is a choice_
- [Ves](https://twitter.com/vesln) (now CTO of AngelList) - _have people around you who always expect the best from you and call your bullshit_
- [Petyo](https://twitter.com/petyosi) (now DoE Stream) - _Nobody knows anything, don’t take yourself too seriously and do your best work_
- [Sitar](https://twitter.com/sitar) ([Investor](https://www.connectventures.co/)) - _passion is the most powerful energy source_
- [Reshma](https://twitter.com/rsohoni) (Founder [Seedcamp](https://seedcamp.com/)) - _relationships are the only things that matters in the end_
- [Bruno Haid](https://twitter.com/brunohaid) (Sparring partner, Founder of multiple companies) – _quality of life is a mindset_

## Berlin

At some point, we decided to downsize Garmz/Lookk a lot. I took myself off the payroll and moved to Berlin to tackle my burnout and come up with new ideas.

To survive, i did a lot of consulting – especially on [product and metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/startup-metrics-a-love-story)

- [Pmoe](https://twitter.com/pmoe) ([Investor](https://tiny.vc/)) - _there is only startup network worldwide and people who create the local uplinks_
- [Giesbert](https://href.li/?https://www.instagram.com/gisbertpoeppler) ([Interior Designer](https://www.gisbertpoeppler.com/)) - _every object in this world around you has a story_
- [Riva](https://twitter.com/rivatez) (Mad Scientist) - _genius, creativity, and craziness are the same things from different sides; embrace it_
- [Peter Henssen](https://twitter.com/phenssen) (Founder of multiple companies) - _you can always reinvent yourself without ever needing to change yourself_
- Yanislav Malakhov (Founder of [Aeternity](https://aeternity.com/)) - _freaks will lead us into the future_
- [Christian](https://twitter.com/wallinchristian?lang=en) & [Margaux](https://twitter.com/mapelen) - _trying to show me how to adult - i didn’t learn anything though._

## SF

One of the "new startup" prototypes became (as MVP) a chrome extension for Product Hunt. This was how i got to know [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover). While barely knowing me, he offered to help me with my new startup ideas.

Fate, and general incompetence when it comes to administration, led to the fact that i all of a sudden had a large tax payment ahead of me. 

This put my own projects on hold. At the same time Ryan's "Product Hunt" side-project started to take off. He asked if i'd freelance for him, we agreed that i'd be too expensive, but i offered to help for whatever he could pay and work for other clients meanwhile.

### Product Hunt

After two weeks working at Product Hunt, Ryan told me that he can raise money for it. Which was good! Because, due to how much there was to do, i didn't really look for any other clients – and i was broke as hell. This led to me joining officially as Founding Team and CTO.

Product Hunt was a tight-knit family with several people staying from beginning to exit.

- [Jacq](https://twitter.com/jacqvon) (Coworker) - _friends are family_
- [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg) (Coworker, now CEO of [On Deck](https://beondeck.com/)) - _you get far by just asking the right questions_
- [Mike](https://twitter.com/mscccc) (Coworker) - i mention a lot about discipline and routine, but i mainly learned from him _how to be a good brother._
- [Ryan](https://twitter.com/rrhoover) (Ex Boss) - _the core of communites are authentic people who give opportunities to random people (like me)_
- [Nick Abouzeid](https://twitter.com/nickabouzeid) (best marketing and ops person i know, funny because he is lawyer) - _you can be good at everything if you want to_

I also managed to convince multiple of the friends listed further above to join as well! For example Lukas, Ves and Rado joined (among many other friends).

### AngelList & SF network 

Product Hunt was a global remote team, but we decided to get several people, who made product decisions, to SF. So several people of my team, my future wife, and me moved to SF without barely planning this through.

To make a very long story short, we got acquired by AngelList. 

At AngelList, I ended up helping or leading product engineering initiatives in [CoinList](https://coinlist.co/) (VPE) and [AngelList Talent](https://angel.co/jobs) ("Head of Remote")

I learned from some of the best people in our industry.

- [Naval](https://twitter.com/naval) (Ex Boss and global first-name celebrity) - _teach people how you think about topics instead of only what you think about them_
- Audrey Kim (Community hyper connector) - _creativity is a source of energy_
- [Onno](https://twitter.com/onnofaber) (Founder of [Rarebase](http://rarebase.com/)) - _you always have [agency](https://href.li/?https://www.ted.com/talks/onno_faber_we_ll_all_be_patients_one_day_jan_2019)_
- [Graham](https://twitter.com/grahamjenkin) (Best manager i ever had) - _do the shit work, make your team look good_
- [Alexis Ohanian](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/) ([Investor](https://sevensevensix.com/) who signed my visa applications) - _you can help a lot of people without ever meeting them_
- [Roy Bahat](https://twitter.com/roybahat) ([Bloomberg Beta])(https://www.bloombergbeta.com/)) - _always create space for inclusion_
- [Paul Davidson](https://twitter.com/pdavison) (ex Boss; now Founder of [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.com/)) - _being passionate and positive will shape the world around you._
- [Pomp](https://twitter.com/APompliano) & [Polina](https://twitter.com/polina_marinova) - _personal brands are media brands and nobody can ever take them from you_
- [Garry Tan](https://twitter.com/garrytan) [Investor](https://initialized.com/) - _actually giving a f^&k and being kind is a competitive advantage in our industry_
- [Marvin Liao](https://twitter.com/marvinliao) - _supporting people worldwide is possible_


## My Fund - Remote First Capital

While working as "Head of Remote" at AngelList, i started to be more and more frustrated that i couldn't get remote teams to be taken serious. I introduced friends to investors who saw "global work" as a small niche in "Future of Work" and always passed. 

For me, there was no future in which we all wouldn't work more globally, digitally, or internationally. 
In classic - screw this; i will do this myself attitude – I decided to raise my own [little fund](https://www.remotefirstcapital.com/) to invest in opportunities of this changing landscape. 

One year later covid came – all of a sudden remote work saved everyone's company.
I was lucky to invest in (and with) many of the people who led the way here.

- [Johnny Boufarhat](https://twitter.com/johnnyboufarhat) (CEO of [Hopin](https://hopin.com/)) - _the fastest growing companies of the future will all be remote_
- [Job](https://twitter.com/jobvo) (CEO of [Remote](https://remote.com/)) - _there is no company too complex, no challenge too hard, no problem too big, that it couldn’t be broken down and handed over to Marcelo to be solved
- [Marcelo Leub](https://twitter.com/marcelo_leub) (CTO of [Remote](https://remote.com/)) - _there are differnt kinds of complexity, the ones you can plan and build for, and the ones you need to first expierence before you build_
- [Joel](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne) (CEO of [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)) - _stay by your values even if the world around you constantly changes_
- [Alex Torrenegra](https://twitter.com/torrenegra) (CEO of [Torre](https://torre.co/)) - _honor your grandparents with your work_
- [Sten](https://twitter.com/seikatsu) (CEO of Estonia… or should be) - _make bets on people_

## On Deck

After leaving AngelList, i joined a seed investment of mine run by [Erik](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), who i worked with at Product Hunt, and [David](https://twitter.com/davidbooth), who i worked with at AngelList – [On Deck](https://beondeck.com/)

- [David Booth](https://twitter.com/david__booth) (Current Boss) - _there is no limit to professional growth_
- _Placeholder for people i work with now. - coming back here in 1-2 years ✌️_

## Honorary mentions: People i never met

I usually only read Sci-Fi books and struggle to read non-fiction. But i wanted to mention a few authors here.

- Dale Carnegie (author) - _for teaching me how humans operate; who would have known…_
- Arthur C. Clarke (author) - _that you can predict the future through extrapolation_


## My Family

In the end, everything comes down to friends and family. I mentioned plenty of friends, and i want to mention learnings from my family too.

- Annemarie (my mother) - _there is *always* a solution_
- Wolfgang (my father) - _you can create your own world with entrepreneurship_
- Nico (my cousin) - _family comes first_
- Jazmin (my cousin's wife) - _life needs fire, love and passion_
- [Susanne Knoll](https://twitter.com/susanneknoll) (my wife) - from whom i learned _literally everything else i know ❤️_


## Final thoughts

Writing this i realize that this list has two common themes:
- how i learned everything from other people during my life
- how i shared experiences with them throughout multiple stages. 

The designer of the music magazine, later became my Co-founder in my startup. 
The developers in this startup, later joined Product Hunt and later become CTOs in AngelList and Product Hunt respectively. 
The Coworkers of Product Hunt later started On Deck where i invested in with my fund and joined as CTO.  

People don't just go in and out of your life – they share large parts of it with you. For me it's most notably with my wife, with whom i share 15+ years of life. She helped me selling ads for the music-magazine, found our first office of the startup, and later helped me file our visas for the US.

I don't know what your big takeaway here is – maybe it's _surround yourself with amazing people, and everything else will happen because of them_ – maybe it's something else.
But in any case i appreciate you taking the time to read this. 

🙏
