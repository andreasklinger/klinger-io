I want to preface this by saying that I have only a mild case of ADHD, eg I don‚Äôt take any medication.

I get regularly asked about my recommendations regarding processes with ADHD.

## Here what i usually recommend:

Dont fight it. See it as superpower. Create systems that ensure you don‚Äôt drop balls.

### How?

In a perfect world, you _only work on stuff that excites and focuses you_. Try to optimize for that. Your distraction can be a spam-filter or search-engine for more interesting stuff.

You might live in this perfect world, most likely you are not.

The exhausting thing about ADHD is _needing to remember stuff_ and _not getting back into what‚Äôs important_ once you got distracted. Find systems for that.

## Systems

Systems to not drop balls / get back into correct topic:

Your goal is to be able to forget stuff (because you will) but have it in a system where it pops up once needed. Can be somewhere during the day or year.

### **Have weekly bullet journals for your tasks**

I explained this here: [https://yourstack.com/pro-tips/85-do-a-weekly-bullet-journal-for-todos](https://href.li/?https://yourstack.com/pro-tips/85-do-a-weekly-bullet-journal-for-todos)

### **Have stuff that‚Äôs further away in your calendar**

Eg yearly reminders, todos that are a few weeks out. Add alerts. Add them so that you can forget.

### **Make it cheap to do stuff quickly**

If you can do stuff instantly you don‚Äôt need to remember stuff at all.

There is multiple productivity hacks.

**My favorites are:**

- Optimize your email

- Use text-snippets for building blocks of common things you type (i got 20 of those)
  - [https://klinger.io/posts/q-codes](https://klinger.io/posts/q-codes)
  - I am always surprised how few people use this‚Ä¶ Are you really typing all of this repetitive stuff all the time?
- Add small products that allow you to do stuff you do regularly quicker
  - Eg add an international clock if you work in international teams
    - [https://yourstack.com/pro-tips/86-if-you-run-a-remote-team-use-this-instead-of-the-normal-clock](https://href.li/?https://yourstack.com/pro-tips/86-if-you-run-a-remote-team-use-this-instead-of-the-normal-clock)
- Structure your decision making processes around important topics
  - eg how you hire, interact with your team, invest etc
    - eg How i make investment decisions
      - [https://klinger.io/posts/how-i-make-investment-decisions](https://klinger.io/posts/how-i-make-investment-decisions)
- Have stuff you write regularly as copypaste
  - eg this used to be copypaste.

### **Put stuff public**

Stuff that you repeat too frequently for 1on1 copypaste you want to put on a public website

Eg this blogpost.

But not only this post, any stuff that I commonly need to talk about. That way I sent a link instead of talking people to death.

- Engineering and Codebase management

- Switching to remote work
