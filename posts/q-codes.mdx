# Q-codes. Stop repeating yourself ⌨️

If anyone asks me what my favorite productivity hack is it might be my [gmail inbox](https://klinger.io/posts/how-to-use-gmail-more-efficiently) setup.

But if anyone asks me what my second fav. productivity hack is… i think it would be having a deadline that’s really close.

But my third favorite one is definitely my q-codes setup.

Let me show you why i love them and why you should get them too!

### Here is how it works

TL;DR: I use apple’s keyboard “text” shortcodes to setup a lot of things i have to type regularly. I prefix them all with q so that they don’t get in the way of my normal writing. Hence i call them *q-codes* ✌️

**Anything i have to type regularly is fair game**

- Full text blocks that i use regularly in emails or text messages
    - eg for hiring replies, copy i use during fundraising, or polite rejections to investment requests, greetings, excuses, etc etc.
    - I tend to keep them short to be able to compose them as needed
- URLs to anything i frequently use
    - eg blogposts i frequently recommend, my [cal.com](http://cal.com) events, my fund’s internal pages, etc
- My personal infos
    - Telephone numbers
    - Addresses
    - even my own name – it’s crazy how frequently you type your own name 🤯

### How?

Plain old’ `Apple > Settings > Keyboard > Text`

Ignore the `omw` – apple keeps readding it with every new laptop.

I actually hate it b/c i used to use `omw` as actual acronym. Prefix your codes so they don’t get in the way. I use and recommend `q–`

I don’t use any textexpander, or some other apps or plugins. 

Why? 

- First: why should i?
- Second: This way it natively works on every device (eg phone, ipad) i own and automatically on every new laptop.

### **Let me show you how i use it**

**Scenario: Someone asks me for an introduction to someone.**

I prefer when people write their own emails that explain why they want the intro. Short emails [i can just forward](https://also.roybahat.com/introductions-and-the-forward-intro-email-14e2827716a1). It leads to better conversion (and tbh here, less work for me).

So someone asks for an intro - i am excited to help - I type `qfwd` as reply

**Scenario: Someone introduces me to someone else via email**

I need to be polite. Thank for the intro and just on a call

`qcc` `qrr` `qan` done.

The advantage of using short text blocks vs full email templates is that

- i can compose them differently as needed
- easily add personalized copy inbetween
- AND use them independently
    - Eg i frequently use `qcc` command in twitter DMs.

**Scenario: I need to sign up to a new website**

Do you know how frequently you type your own name or email address? It’s absurd. Registering to a new service is a good example for this.

`qak` `qem` done.

### Easy enough 💪

All of them also works on mobile. In any app you use. On any device you have.

I have dozen q-codes more but you get the gist.

Go to your keyboard settings and set them up now. 🙂
